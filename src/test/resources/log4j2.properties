# This is the configuration file for log4j.
# Comments are in Hash!
# Here is where you tell log4j what you want to see in your log. There are various levels of logging:
# Debug, info, warning, error, fatal.
# you can configure which level and from which source you want.
#also you can tell where you want your log to go: to the screen, to a file,
#but what is the info message here? 5level? What the name says: information. It depends on your program,
# it is up to the programmer decide.
#
# I KNOW but WHERE is this page that is INFO?? which line?
